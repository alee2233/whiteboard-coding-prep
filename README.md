# Coding Interview Simulator
This application is a tool to help a software engineering candidate prepare for coding/whiteboard interviews.
Most questions and hints are taken directly from *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition*, by Gayle L. McDowell. This tool is not a replacement for the book, but a supplement that can be used to review questions. There are no solutions provided in this app, please refer to the the book for them.

Learn more about the book or purchase it [here](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), I strongly recommend it!
